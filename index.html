                    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
                        <p>Socrates clashed with the current course of Athenian politics and was sentenced to death. Socrates chose death before submitting to censorship and surrendering his right to free thought and free expression. He was found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety and subsequently sentenced to death by drinking a mixture containing poison hemlock.</p>

                    <h2>What Was the Impact?</h2>
                        <p>The struggle for free speech caused a lot of concern for religious censorship from pre-christian rulers as orthodoxy became established.</p>

                    <h2>What Was the Impact?</h2>
                        <p>The M.O.I. was Britain's propaganda arm. They started and maintained propaganda campaigns for use against British citizens and others in non-occupied neutral countries. Propaganda at home kept morale up whereas propaganda in neutral countries attempted to sway their neutrality.</p>

                        <p>New York City hosts the World's Fair in 1939. Great Britain was granted an exhibition there.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>What Was the Impact?</h2>
                        <p>Great Britain used this as a means to help sway the U.S into another war against the Germans. The Magna Carta and other British cultural icons were put on display. This, a visit from the King and Queen, and other propaganda in the U.S. eventually swayed the war-weary U.S. public into supporting another war against Germany.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h2>What Was the Impact?</h2>
                        <p>The U.S. employed multiple forms of anti-communist propaganda in a campaign led by Senator McCarthy (hence the name McCarthyism). The propaganda campaigns were so effective that the U.S, to this day, is wary of communist policies. This is most notable in their politics - where "socialist" is deemed an insult. If the Red Scare was less effective, Bernie Sanders may have won the presidential election.</p>
