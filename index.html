                    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
                        <p>Socrates clashed with the current course of Athenian politics and was sentenced to death. Socrates chose death before submitting to censorship and surrendering his right to free thought and free expression. He was found guilty of both corrupting the minds of the youth of Athens and of impiety and subsequently sentenced to death by drinking a mixture containing poison hemlock.</p>

                    <h2>What Was the Impact?</h2>
                        <p>The struggle for free speech caused a lot of concern for religious censorship from pre-christian rulers as orthodoxy became established.</p>

Propaganda was often target towards children because of their easily deceived minds; and was used often in schools.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, because these networks are often rushed in publishing such articles, more and more often, we see cases of inaccurate reporting. A few days before the 2016 American election, many news outlets published stories favoring the democrats to win the election. The Huffington Post had placed the odds of a Hilary Clinton win at 98.2 percent. The predicted Electoral College votes were 323 for Clinton to 215 for Trump. As we all know, this was not the result of the election.</p>
